# tcpcontroller
Well, this is simple app, made just for fun that enables a possibility to remote control computer using simple commands.
You can create your own commands using a "config" file (or even multiple files) placed somewhere on the computer. Besides that
you can also set a "password" for client to authenticate.

#TODO
- GUI (gui branch, flutter)
- client (for now I'm using an app called TCP Client for android)
